# Overview

TriggerMap is designed as a mental fitness logâ€”a tool to help you track and improve your emotional and mental well-being. Much like a gym log records your physical workouts and progress, TriggerMap allows you to log emotional triggers and your responses to them.

## Why TriggerMap?

- **Self-Awareness:** By logging your triggers and reflections, you build a clearer understanding of your emotional patterns.
- **Mental Fitness:** Regular reflection can help you develop resilience, foster mindfulness, and improve mental health.
- **Structured Reflection:** The 7-step process guides you through a detailed reflection, ensuring you capture all aspects of an emotional event.
- **Actionable Insights:** Over time, reviewing your logs can reveal trends and help you make informed changes to improve your mental fitness.

This approach is ideal for anyone looking to maintain or improve their mental well-being through regular, structured self-reflection.
