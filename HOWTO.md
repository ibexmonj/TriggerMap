# How to Use the Trigger Form

The TriggerMap app uses a structured 7-step form to help you log your emotional triggers and reflect on your experience. Below is an explanation of each field in the form:

- **Event:**  
  A description of the incident or situation that triggered your emotional response. Provide as much detail as necessary to recall the context of the event.

- **Emotions:**  
  List the emotions you felt during the event. This can include primary emotions (like anger, sadness, or joy) and secondary emotions (such as frustration or anxiety).

- **Internal Narrative:**  
  Describe the thoughts or story you told yourself about the event. This is your inner dialogue or interpretation of what happened.

- **Violated Core Needs:**  
  Identify which of your core needs you believe were unmet or violated during the event. This helps pinpoint the deeper impact the trigger had on you.

- **Deeper Truth:**  
  Reflect on a more compassionate or insightful perspective regarding the event. This might include understanding broader contexts or realizing personal growth opportunities.

- **Ideal Alternative:**  
  Consider what you would have preferred to experience instead of the event as it unfolded. This represents your ideal scenario or a healthier response.

- **Action:**  
  State the next step or action you plan to take in response to the trigger. This can be a strategy for self-care, reaching out for support, or a commitment to change a particular pattern.

This guided process is designed to act as your mental fitness log, helping you build self-awareness and resilience over time.
